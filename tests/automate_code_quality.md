# Python Code Review & Automation


## Code Review Tools
### Code Analysis/Linting
- Linting highlights syntactical and stylistic problems in your Python source code, which oftentimes helps you identify and correct subtle programming errors or unconventional coding practices that can lead to errors
- Two most popular python linters: Pylint and Flake8

#### Flake8
Flake8 is a simple wrapper around pyflakes, pycodestyle and mccabe

- Install `Flake8`
    ```bash
    pip install flake8
    ```
- Add an extension for the `pycodestyle` (doc strings) tool to flake8

    - Install `flake8-docstrings`
        ```bash
        pip install flake8-docstrings
        ```
    - You can set the pydocstyle convention at the command line. Possible conventions are: pep257, numpy, google.
        ```bash
        flake8 --docstring-convention google .
        ```
- Add an extension for `pep8-naming` (naming convention) tool to flake8
    ```bash
    pip install pep8-naming
    ```
- Run flake8:
    ```bash
    flake8 .        # lint the whole project
    flake test.py   # lint test.py file
    ```
 
#### Pylint
Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions.

Itâ€™s highly configurable, having special pragmas to control its errors and warnings from within your code, as well as from an extensive configuration file
- Install `Pylint`
    ```bash
    pip install pylint
    ```
- Run `Pylint`
    ```
    pylint src    # lint the src directory
    ```

### Automatic Code Formatting
#### Black
- Black is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter. Black reformats entire files in place. It is not configurable. It doesn't take previous formatting into account. Your main option of configuring Black is that it doesn't reformat blocks that start with # fmt: off and end with # fmt: on, or lines that ends with # fmt: skip. Pay attention that # fmt: on/off have to be on the same level of indentation
- Black code style: [reference](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/the_black_code_style.md)
- Usage
  - Install `black`
      ```bash
      pip install black
      ```

  - Run `black` formatter
      ```bash
      black [file/dir]
      ```

#### Autopep8
- autopep8 automatically formats Python code to conform to the PEP 8 style guide. It uses the pycodestyle utility to determine what parts of the code needs to be formatted. autopep8 is capable of fixing most of the formatting issues that can be reported by pycodestyle.
- autopep8 document: [reference](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/)
- Usage
  - Install `autopep8`
      ```bash
      pip install autopep8
      ```

  - Run `autopep8` formatter
      ```bash
      autopep8 [file/dir] --in-place
      ```

#### yapf
- Yet Another Python Formatter (yapf) is a python formatter from Google based on ideas from gofmt. In essence, the algorithm takes the code and reformats it to the best formatting that conforms to the style guide, even if the original code didn't violate the style guide. This is also more configurable and a good option for automatic code formatting. 
- yapf docs: [reference](https://github.com/google/yapf)
- Usage
  - Install `yapf`
      ```bash
      pip install yapf
      ```

  - Run `yapf` formatter
      ```bash
      yapf [file/dir] --in-place
      ```

## Code Review Automation
### VS Code Extension
Refer to official document from Microsoft: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting

### Make-based Utility
What is make? http://cs.boisestate.edu/~alark/cs253/notes/make_utility.pdf
Below is an example of Makefile for python project

```make
# Change the shell
SHELL:= /bin/bash

# Phony targets are targets that do not correspond to a file
.PHONY: clean venv build docs help

# build has a dependency list
build: clean venv docs
    	# To suppress echoing commands to shell, add @ to beginning of each command
    	# Continued onto another line by putting a \ at the end of the first line
    	# Each command must be indented with a tab
	@echo "Build package for development"; \
	source venv/bin/activate; \
	python setup.py install;

clean:
	# When it is time to execute commands to update a target, they are executed by making a new subshell for each line.
	# For ex: shell commands such as cd that set variables local to each process will not affect the following command lines.
	# If you want to use cd to affect the next command, put the two on a single line with a semicolon between them. 
	# Then make will consider them a single command and pass them, together, to a shell which will execute them in sequence
	@echo "Clean development environment"; \
	rm -rf build; \
	rm -rf dist; \
	rm -rf *.egg-info; \
	rm -rf venv;

venv:
	@echo "Create and build virtualenv for development"; \
	virtualenv -p python3 venv; \
	source venv/bin/activate; \
	pip install -r requirements.txt;

docs:
	@echo "Build docs for project";

help:
	@echo "Supported commands"; \
	cat Makefile;
```

## Practice

Build a make utility for your own project which supports
- Create a new dev environment target
- Code linting and formatting target
- Other targets such as help, docs, build, clean,...
